## Methodology

This project leverages SQL queries to analyze the Walmart sales data stored in a relational database:

### Data Preparation:

- The Walmart sales dataset is imported into a relational database management system MySQL.
- The data is organized into appropriate tables with relevant columns.

### SQL Queries:

- SQL queries are written to answer the key questions listed above.
- Queries may involve aggregation functions, joins, filtering, and grouping to extract meaningful insights from the data.

### Analysis and Reporting:

- The results of the SQL queries are analyzed to identify patterns and trends in the data.
- Reports are generated to summarize the findings and present them in a clear and concise manner.
